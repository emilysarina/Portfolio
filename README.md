# Emily Sarina Ekins â€“ Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, originally built before my first developer role to showcase my early projects and bootcamp experience. Itâ€™s a React-based single-page app with custom styling and a clean, section-based layout.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

The original version is still live while I build this refresh. Most recent client work is under NDA, but Iâ€™m happy to talk through specific projects on request.

Live site can be seen [here](https://emilysarina.github.io/Portfolio/)

## ðŸ›  Planned Updates

As Iâ€™ve grown into a mid-weight full-stack (front-end focused!) developer, Iâ€™m planning a refresh to better reflect my current experience, skills, and style.

### âœ… Key Improvements

- **Updated About Section**  
  Rewrite to reflect recent client work, collaboration with design/content teams, and accessibility/testing focus.

- **Tech Stack Overview**  
  Add a visual or tag-based section to highlight tools and frameworks (React, TypeScript, Playwright, etc.).

- **Testing Experience**  
  Include mention of automated tests with Cypress, Playwright, and Jest.

- **Contact Form with Backend Logic**  
  Build a form using a backend handler (Node, Netlify Function, or similar) to demonstrate full-stack ability.

- **Polish & Responsiveness**  
  Improve mobile experience, tweak layout spacing, and ensure clean visual flow.

- **Data Visualisation Example (Nice to Have)**  
  Add a small demo or component that shows charting or dashboard-style visualisation.

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- CSS Modules
- Figma-based design implementation
- Planned: Netlify Functions or Express backend for contact form
